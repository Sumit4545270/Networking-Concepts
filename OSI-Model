🏛 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

👉 OSI is a reference model made by ISO (International Standards Organization).
It explains how data travels from one computer to another in 7 layers.

        Think of it like sending a letter 📩 through a postal system:
        
        You write it (Application layer),
        
        Pack it (Presentation, Session, Transport),
        
        Put address on it (Network),
        
        Put it in an envelope (Data Link),
        
        And a postman physically carries it (Physical).

📚 The 7 Layers (Top → Bottom)
7. Application Layer

        What it does: This is where user applications interact with the network.
        
        Example protocols: HTTP (web), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email), DNS (domain names).
        
        Device: End-user software (browsers, apps).
        
        Think: “The layer you actually see and use.”

6. Presentation Layer

        What it does:
        
        Converts data into a format both sender and receiver understand.
        
        Handles encryption (security), compression (smaller size), translation (ASCII, JPEG, etc.).
        
        Example protocols: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG.
        
        Think: “The translator — makes data readable and secure.”

5. Session Layer

        What it does:
        
        Creates, manages, and ends sessions (continuous connections).
        
        Adds checkpoints in long communication, so if something fails, it resumes.
        
        Example protocols: NetBIOS, RPC.
        
        Think: “The meeting manager — who talks, when, and how long.”

4. Transport Layer

        What it does:
        
        Breaks large data into segments.
        
        Uses ports (like 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) to identify applications.
        
        Ensures data is delivered correctly and in order (TCP) or just sends it fast without checking (UDP).
        
        Protocols: TCP, UDP.
        
        Think: “The delivery guarantee guy — reliable/unreliable delivery.”

3. Network Layer

        What it does:
        
        Adds logical addressing (IP addresses).
        
        Decides the best path to the destination (routing).
        
        Protocols: IP, ICMP, OSPF, BGP.
        
        Devices: Routers.
        
        Think: “The GPS — finds the route to the destination.”

2. Data Link Layer

        What it does:
        
        Adds MAC address (unique hardware address of devices).
        
        Packages data into frames.
        
        Checks errors using FCS (Frame Check Sequence).
        
        Protocols/Tech: Ethernet, ARP.
        
        Devices: Switches, bridges.
        
        Think: “The local delivery guy — delivers only inside the neighborhood (LAN).”

1. Physical Layer

        What it does:
        
        Converts data into bits (0s & 1s).
        
        Defines cables, signals, voltage, radio frequencies.
        
        Devices: Cables, hubs, NICs, repeaters.
        
        Think: “The actual road where cars (data bits) travel.”

🔄 Encapsulation (How data travels)

        When you send data:
        
        App data → Transport adds port info → Network adds IP → Data Link adds MAC → Physical sends bits.
        When you receive data:
        
        The process is reversed (decapsulation).

🌟 Key Exam/Interview Points

        OSI = 7 layers (Application → Physical).
        
        Routing happens at Layer 3 (Network).
        
        Switching happens at Layer 2 (Data Link).
        
        Encryption usually at Layer 6 (Presentation).
        
        Port numbers at Layer 4 (Transport).
        
        Cables, signals at Layer 1 (Physical).

✅ One Line Summary:
        The OSI model is a 7-layer framework that explains how data moves from one device to another — from user applications (Layer 7) down to physical signals (Layer 1).
