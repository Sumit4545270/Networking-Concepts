🌐 1. Subnet Mask (SM)

Subnet mask = defines which part is Network ID and which part is Host ID.

Example:

        IP: 192.168.1.10
        
        Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        
        Network = 192.168.1
        
        Host = 10

👉 Rule:

        1 in mask (binary) = Network portion
        
        0 in mask = Host portion

🔢 2. Binary Representation

        Subnet masks are written in binary:
        
        255 = 11111111
        
        0 = 00000000

Example:
        255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

👉 Here /24 means first 24 bits = network, last 8 bits = hosts.

🧮 3. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

        CIDR notation = shortcut to write subnet mask.
        
        /8 → 255.0.0.0
        
        /16 → 255.255.0.0
        
        /24 → 255.255.255.0

📊 4. Hosts Calculation Formula

        Number of hosts = 2^n - 2
        (where n = no. of host bits (0s in mask)).

-2 because 1 address = Network ID, 1 = Broadcast.
