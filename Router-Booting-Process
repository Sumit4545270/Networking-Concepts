🚦 Router Booting Process (Step by Step in Simple Words)
1️⃣ POST (Power-On Self Test)

        English → When router turns ON, it checks its hardware (RAM, CPU, interfaces).
        
        Hindi → Jaise tu computer on karta hai aur wo apna RAM/Keyboard test karta hai, waise hi router bhi apna hardware check karta hai.

2️⃣ Bootstrap Program

        English → A small program in ROM that decides from where to load the Operating System (IOS).
        
        Hindi → Ye bootstrap ek chhota software hai jo decide karta hai IOS kaha se uthana hai (Flash ya TFTP server).
👉 Same as computer ka BIOS jo bolta hai Windows hard disk se load hoga ya pendrive se.

3️⃣ Load IOS (Internetwork Operating System)

        English → Router loads its brain (IOS = Internetwork Operating System) from Flash memory.
        
        Hindi → Router apna dimaag (IOS software) load karta hai Flash se. Agar nahi mila, to dusre jagah (TFTP server) se try karega.

4️⃣ Find Configuration File

        English → Router looks in NVRAM for a file called startup-config. This file has all saved settings.
        
        Hindi → Ab router apni settings dhundta hai NVRAM me (IP addresses, passwords, routing info).

5️⃣ Apply Configuration / Setup Mode

English →

        If config found → Router applies settings and becomes ready.
        
        If config not found → Router enters setup mode (asks you to configure manually).

Hindi →

        Agar settings mili → Router turant chal padta hai.
        
        Agar settings nahi mili → Router bolega "Bhai config bata de" (Setup mode).

⚡ Shortcut Analogy (Computer se relate karke)

        POST = Computer ka power on check
        
        Bootstrap = BIOS
        
        IOS load = Windows load
        
        Config file = Settings / Drivers load hona
        
        Setup mode = Agar OS fresh install ho to nayi settings dalni padti hai
