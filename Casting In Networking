📡 Types of Communication in Networking
1️⃣ Unicast

        Meaning: One sender → One receiver
        
        Example: Sending a WhatsApp message directly to your friend.
        
        Cost (Bandwidth): 🔹 Lowest (only 2 devices involved).

2️⃣ Broadcast

        Meaning: One sender → All devices in the network
        
        Example: ARP request (Who has this IP?) goes to everyone in LAN.
        
        Cost (Bandwidth): 🔸 High (every device receives data, even if not needed).

3️⃣ Multicast

        Meaning: One sender → Selected group of receivers
        
        Example: Live streaming a cricket match (only interested users join the stream).
        
        Cost (Bandwidth): ⚖️ Medium (better than broadcast, more efficient).

✅ Shortcut to Remember:

        Unicast → 1 to 1
        Broadcast → 1 to All
        Multicast → 1 to Many (specific group)
