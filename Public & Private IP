🌍 Public vs 🔒 Private IP
1. Public IP (Global IP)
        📡 Visible to everyone on Internet
        Like your home address in real world. Anyone can send you a letter.
        Unique worldwide (no two houses can have same postal address).
        Given by ISP.
👉 Example: 49.37.128.56 (real public IP you get from Airtel/Jio/BSNL).

2. Private IP (Local IP)
        🏠 Only works inside your home/office network (LAN)
        Like your flat number inside a building — unique in building, but many cities may have flat no. 101.
        Not routable on Internet.
        Used for internal communication (PC ↔ printer, mobile ↔ Wi-Fi).
👉 Example:

        Class A Private: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
        Class B Private: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
        Class C Private: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
 (Common: 192.168.1.1 = Wi-Fi router default).
3. How They Work Together
        Your laptop may have a Private IP (192.168.1.5).
        Your router has a Public IP (103.45.67.89).
        When you open Google → router changes your private IP to public (via NAT = Network Address Translation) → sends request.
        Reply comes to router → router sends it back to your private IP.
👉 Think of it like:

        Flat no. (Private IP) + Building main address (Public IP)
        Courier company only knows the building address, but watchman (router) delivers parcel inside your flat.
