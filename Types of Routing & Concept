Nice — I’ll explain every major type of routing in a clear, step-by-step way so you can relate, visualize, and remember. I’ll use plain English with short Hindi lines where useful, give simple analogies, show how it works, metrics, how it avoids loops, where to use it, pros/cons, and short Cisco examples you can try.

Quick bird’s-eye view (so you know the map)
Routing types we’ll cover (big to small):

Static routing (manual)

Default routing (last-resort)

Dynamic routing (automatic) — split into families:

        Distance-Vector (RIP)
        Link-State (OSPF, IS-IS)
        Hybrid (EIGRP)
        Path-Vector (BGP)
        Policy-Based Routing (PBR) (rule based)

Special topics: Administrative Distance, Longest Prefix Match, ECMP, Redistribute & Summarization.

Each section below: What it is → How it works → Analogy → Metric & loop control → Use cases → Pros/Cons → Small config/troubleshoot tips.

1) Static Routing — manual fixed maps
        What: Routes that an administrator types into the router. Router just uses them.
        Analogy: You always take the same fixed road to office — no GPS, no changes.
        How it works: ip route <dest> <mask> <next-hop/interface> — router forwards by that next-hop. No learning, no updates.
        Loop control: None automatic — admin must avoid loops.
        When to use: Small networks, stub branches, simple point-to-point links, backup/float routes.
        Pros: Simple, predictable, zero routing-protocol overhead, secure.
        Cons: Not scalable, needs manual changes on failures.

Cisco example:

# direct route
        ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2

# default route (floating)
        ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1

# floating static (acts as backup) with AD 200
        ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.1.1.2 200
        Troubleshoot: check show ip route for presence and correct next-hop; ping next-hop; show ip interface brief.

2) Default Routing — “if unknown, send here”
        What: A single catch-all route used when no specific route exists.
        Analogy: If you’re lost, go to the city center (ISP) and ask directions.
        Use: Branch offices, edge routers that point to ISP, very small networks.
        Pros: Very easy.
        Cons: Not useful deep inside a multi-path network; can create suboptimal routing.

Config: 
        ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>

3) Dynamic Routing — routers learn & adapt automatically
        Big idea: Routers exchange information, compute best path, and update routing tables automatically. Good for scale and resilience.
        Tradeoff: More CPU/memory and control traffic (hellos, updates).

Dynamic families:

3A) Distance-Vector (example: RIP)
        Concept: Each router tells its neighbors "I can reach networks X with cost Y (hop count)". Routers update their tables based on neighbors’ reports.
        Analogy: You ask neighbors how many turns away a place is and pick the neighbor report.
        Metric: Hop count (each router = 1). RIP max = 15 hops (16 = unreachable).
        Loop control: Split horizon, poison reverse, hold-downs. These reduce loops but are imperfect.
        Behavior: Periodic full/partial updates (RIP v1), RIP v2 supports classless/VLSM and multicast updates. Convergence is slow compared to link-state.
        Use cases: Small legacy networks, labs, learning. Not for modern large networks.

Cisco example:

        router rip
         version 2
         network 10.0.0.0
         no auto-summary

Pros: Simple.
Cons: Slow convergence, low hop limit, not scalable.

3B) Link-State (example: OSPF, IS-IS)
        Concept: Each router discovers the entire network topology (via Link State Advertisements — LSAs) and runs Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) to compute best paths.
        Analogy: Everyone builds the entire city map and then computes the shortest path themselves.
        Metric: OSPF uses cost, typically based on interface bandwidth (cost = reference_bw / intf_bw). Cisco default reference bandwidth historically 100 Mbps (adjust for multi-Gbps networks).
        Loop control: SPF avoids loops by computing the loop-free shortest path; LSA flooding and sequence numbers prevent stale info.
        Behavior: Routers send hello packets, form adjacencies on multiaccess networks (DR/BDR election), flood LSAs when topology changes, fast reconvergence. OSPF supports hierarchical design via areas (Area 0 backbone).
        Use cases: Enterprise networks (campus, datacenter), large-scale internal routing.

Key OSPF concepts to know: Areas (area 0 backbone), LSA types (1–5), DR/BDR on Ethernet, OSPF costs, LSDB.
Cisco example:

        router ospf 1
         network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
Pros: Fast convergence, scalable with areas, predictable metrics.
Cons: More complex configuration; LSDB resource use, careful area design required.

3C) Hybrid (example: EIGRP — Cisco)
        Concept: EIGRP combines ideas of distance-vector and link-state: it advertises distance info but maintains topology tables, tracks feasible successors for quick failover. Uses DUAL algorithm.
        Analogy: You ask neighbors, but you also keep a mini-map and have guaranteed backup routes precomputed.
        Metric: Composite (bandwidth + delay by default). K values control metric calculation (K1..K5).
        Loop control: DUAL algorithm with feasibility condition (reported distance < feasible distance) avoids loops and allows immediate failover to feasible successor.
        Use cases: Large Cisco networks where quick convergence and easy scaling are desired.
Cisco example:

        router eigrp 100
         network 10.0.0.0
         no auto-summary
Pros: Fast convergence, efficient backups, scalable in Cisco environments.
Cons: Cisco proprietary (historically), metric complexity.

3D) Path-Vector (example: BGP) — the Internet’s protocol
        Concept: Routers (BGP peers) exchange full path information (AS-PATH) and many attributes; policy drives selection more than pure shortest path. BGP is about policies and reachability between Autonomous Systems (ASes).
        Analogy: Airlines deciding routes based on cost, alliances, and policies — not only distance.
        Key attributes: AS_PATH, NEXT_HOP, LOCAL_PREF, MED, ORIGIN, COMMUNITY.
        Loop control: AS_PATH prevents loops (if your AS appears in AS_PATH, you discard).
        Behavior: BGP uses TCP (reliable), sessions between peers, incremental updates. Convergence can be slow on large Internet changes; BGP is policy-driven.
        Use cases: ISP peering, multi-homed enterprises, traffic engineering.

Cisco example (basic eBGP):

        router bgp 65010
         neighbor 203.0.113.2 remote-as 65020
         network 198.51.100.0 mask 255.255.255.0
Pros: Powerful policy control, scale for Internet.
Cons: Complex; must understand attributes to avoid routing issues.

4) Policy-Based Routing (PBR)
        What: Override normal routing decision based on ACLs/rules (source, dest, protocol, ports).
        Analogy: “If I’m going to the market and I have groceries, go by car; if I’m going to the gym, take bike.”
        Use: Route specific traffic (e.g., VoIP via MPLS, bulk backup via cheaper Internet link).
Cisco snippet:

        access-list 101 permit ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
        route-map WEB-OUT permit 10
         match ip address 101
         set ip next-hop 10.20.20.1
        interface Gig0/1
         ip policy route-map WEB-OUT
Caution: PBR can conflict with dynamic routing, needs careful testing.

Core routing decision rules (how routers choose among multiple routes)
        Longest Prefix Match — most specific route wins (e.g., /28 wins over /24).
        Administrative Distance (AD) — if two sources advertise identical prefix, the route with lower AD is preferred. (Common ADs: connected 0, static 1, eBGP 20, EIGRP int 90, OSPF 110, RIP 120, iBGP 200).
        Metric — within the same protocol, the route with better metric (lower cost/hop/distance) wins.
        ECMP — if multiple equal-cost next-hops exist, router may load-share (Equal-Cost Multi-Path).
Important advanced topics (brief, but essential)
Route Summarization (Aggregation)
        Combine multiple prefixes into one advertisement (reduces table size). Example: summarize 10.0.0.0/24–10.0.3.0/24 into 10.0.0.0/22.
        Do at network edges/area boundaries for efficiency.
Route Redistribution
        When using multiple routing protocols (e.g., OSPF + BGP), you may need to redistribute routes from one protocol into another.
        Danger: can create loops and metrics confusion. Use route tags and careful filtering.
Convergence & Timers
        Convergence = time routers take to agree on new topology after a change. Link-state and DUAL converge faster than basic distance-vector.
        Tune timers (hello/dead intervals in OSPF/RIP/EIGRP) only when needed.
Loop prevention techniques
Distance vector: split horizon, poison reverse, hold-down.
Link state/path vector: topology information + AS path avoids loops.
Troubleshooting checklist (how to debug routing problems)
        Interface status: show ip interface brief (up/up?)
        
        IP addressing & masks: show run | include interface — correct subnets?
        
        Routing table: show ip route — do you have expected routes? From which protocol?
        
        Neighbors/peers:

                OSPF: show ip ospf neighbor
                EIGRP: show ip eigrp neighbors / show ip eigrp topology
                BGP: show ip bgp summary
                RIP: show ip rip database / show ip route rip
                Ping/Traceroute: confirm reachability and next hops.

        Check AD/metrics: a route may be present but not chosen due to AD/metric.
        
        Check ACLs/firewall/NAT — traffic may be allowed in routing table but blocked elsewhere.
        
        Check route-maps / distribute-lists / prefix-lists that filter advertisements.

How to choose a routing protocol? (simple rules)
        Tiny/simple static networks → Static + Default
        Small enterprise / labs → RIP only for learning
        Campus / enterprise → OSPF (multi-vendor) or EIGRP if Cisco-only and you want faster convergence
        Large ISPs / Internet edge / multi-homed → BGP
        Need per-application steering → PBR
Short configuration cheat-sheet (copyable)

Final TL;DR (one-sentence memory hooks)
        Static = Admin sets fixed roads.
        Default = “If unknown, send to ISP/main hub.”
        RIP = Ask neighbors how many turns (hop) — old & slow.
        OSPF = Everyone builds a map — fastest to converge in enterprise.
        EIGRP = Cisco hybrid — fast with backups.
        BGP = Internet policy engine — AS paths & attributes.
        PBR = Route by rules, not by best path.
