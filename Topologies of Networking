🖧 Network Topologies – Detailed Explanation
1️⃣ What is a Topology?

Topology = the way devices (computers, switches, routers, printers) are physically or logically connected in a network.
👉 Simply: How devices are arranged & how data flows between them.

There are two types:

  Physical Topology → actual physical layout (cables, devices).
  
  Logical Topology → how data moves (flow of information).

2️⃣ Types of Topologies
🔹 A) Bus Topology

        Structure: All devices share a single backbone cable.
        
        Data travels in both directions along the cable.
        
        If two devices send at the same time → collision happens.
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Easy to install, uses less cable.
        
        Cost-effective for small networks.
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        If main cable breaks, whole network fails.
        
        Collisions increase with more devices (slow performance).

🔹 B) Star Topology

        Structure: All devices connect to a central device (switch/hub).
        
        Data always passes through the central hub.
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Easy to manage & troubleshoot.
        
        If one cable fails → only that device is affected.
        
        High performance (no collisions in switches).
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        If central hub/switch fails, whole network goes down.
        
        Needs more cable → more cost.

🔹 C) Ring Topology

        Structure: Devices connected in a circular way (each device has 2 neighbors).
        
        Data moves in one direction (or both in dual ring).
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Predictable data flow (no collision).
        
        Equal access for all devices.
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        If one device or cable fails → entire network can fail.
        
        Harder to troubleshoot.

🔹 D) Mesh Topology

        Structure: Every device is connected to every other device.
        
        Two types:
        
        Full Mesh → all devices connected to each other.
        
        Partial Mesh → some devices fully connected.
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Very reliable (multiple paths available).
        
        High security and fault tolerance.
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        Very costly (lots of cables & ports needed).
        
        Complex to install/manage.

🔹 E) Tree Topology

        Structure: Combination of Star + Bus.
        
        Multiple star networks connected using a main backbone cable.
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Easy to expand.
        
        Fault in one branch doesn’t affect others.
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        Backbone failure = entire network down.
        
        More cable needed.

🔹 F) Hybrid Topology

        Structure: Combination of two or more topologies (example: Star + Ring).
        
        Common in large enterprises.
        
        ✅ Advantages:
        
        Flexible & scalable.
        
        Can be designed as per requirements.
        
        ❌ Disadvantages:
        
        Very complex design.

Expensive to maintain.
