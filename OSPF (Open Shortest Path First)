Bhai ab aate hain OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) pe – isko detail + simple tareeke se samjh le, RIP aur EIGRP ke baad tu easily relate kar lega 🚀

🔹 OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
1️⃣ What is OSPF?
        Link-State Routing Protocol (RIP aur EIGRP jaise Distance Vector nahi).
        Open Standard hai (sab vendors use kar sakte hain, sirf Cisco tak limited nahi).
        Metric = Cost (based on Bandwidth) → higher bandwidth = lower cost (better path).
        Works on Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) Algorithm.
👉 Matlab: Poore network ka map banata hai aur usme se sabse short path nikalta hai.

2️⃣ How OSPF Works (Step by Step)
        Hello Packets → Routers neighbors ko discover karte hain (multicast 224.0.0.5).
        Adjacency Formation → Neighbor routers ke sath relationship banata hai.
        LSA (Link State Advertisements) → Har router apne connected networks ki info broadcast karta hai.
        LSDB (Link State Database) → Sab routers ke paas ek hi complete network map hota hai.
        SPF Algorithm → Har router apne aap best path calculate karta hai.
        Routing Table → Best path ko apne routing table me daal deta hai.
👉 Is wajah se OSPF fast converge karta hai aur loop-free hota hai.

3️⃣ OSPF Areas
        Backbone Area (Area 0) → Sabhi dusre areas isse connect hone chahiye.
        Normal Areas → Simple internal areas.
        Stub Areas → Outside routes allowed nahi, sirf default route.
        NSSA (Not-So-Stubby Area) → Limited external routes allowed.
👉 Areas ka use scalability ke liye hota hai (network bahut bada ho jaye to break into parts).

4️⃣ OSPF Metric (Cost)
Formula:
        Cost = (ReferenceBandwidthCost / InterfaceBandwidth)
​
 
Default Reference Bandwidth = 100 Mbps.

Example:

        FastEthernet (100 Mbps) → Cost = 1
        10 Mbps link → Cost = 10
        1 Gbps link → Cost = 0.1 (rounded to 1 if default ref not changed)
👉 Matlab hamesha fastest link ko prefer karega.

5️⃣ OSPF Packet Types
        Hello – Neighbor discovery.
        DBD (Database Description) – LSDB summary exchange.
        LSR (Link State Request) – Router asks for details.
        LSU (Link State Update) – Router shares details.
        LSAck – Acknowledgement of updates.
6️⃣ OSPF Tables
        Neighbor Table → Directly connected routers.
        Topology Table (LSDB) → Full network map.
        Routing Table → Best paths from LSDB.
7️⃣ OSPF Router Types
        Internal Router → Belongs to one area.
        Backbone Router → Inside Area 0.
        Area Border Router (ABR) → Connects multiple areas.
        Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) → Connects OSPF to other protocols (like BGP, RIP).
8️⃣ OSPF Advantages
        ✅ Fast convergence.
        ✅ Loop-free (SPF algorithm).
        ✅ VLSM & CIDR support.
        ✅ Scalable with areas.
        ✅ Open Standard (not vendor locked).

9️⃣ OSPF Disadvantages
        ❌ More CPU and memory usage than RIP/EIGRP.
        ❌ Complex to configure for beginners.
        ❌ Small networks me overkill hai (zyada heavy).

🧠 One-line Memory Hooks
        OSPF = Link-State Protocol.
        Algorithm = Dijkstra SPF.
        Metric = Cost (bandwidth-based).
        Areas = Backbone (0), Stub, NSSA.
        Tables = Neighbor, LSDB, Routing.
        Hello → LSA → SPF → Routing Table.
